Hi! This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

What I've learned:
* Flexbox!
* Semantic HTML
* That coding clean CSS with clever selectors is hard (there are some things that still need polishing)
* Sizing & spacing
* SVGs


------------

What I need to do next:
 * Use Git in a more efficient way (I now watched and practiced with Colt Stelee's *The Git & Github Bootcamp* )
 * Update all fixed properties with relatives ones (start using only em and rem)
 * Deploy this!
